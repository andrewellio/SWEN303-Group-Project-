For Part 2 of the project, planning the usability test plan was possible, since we as a team contributed to it. We all brainstormed and came up with an idea on how to do it. 

First, I helped on the discussion on what are the main tasks for our project and also helped on the plans of testing them. After writing all the tasks to test the usability of our project, we had to make sure that they are error free, so I helped revise them by reading it over and correct any problems. 

Now that the test plan is finalized, each member of the team is assigned to a role for the user testing. I was given the role of a “helper”, which helps the testers if they are stuck when testing our project. Even though our project was simple, I was still able to help some testers stuck on some contents in our project.

The test result was also a group discussion where I took part in it. I was able to help separate the problems from the testers’ feedback as well as help rank them in our problem severity chart. 

Issues from the test result were also distributed evenly throughout our group. I was given 4 issues to resolve (which can be seen in the issues page of our gitlab page), but due to our time limit, it was impossible to resolve them. 

Overall, my responsibility as a group member was achieved as I was able to give in some ideas on how to do the project and improvements. Also, I was able to help resolve some problems that occur during the creation of the projects and aswell as answering the tasks required.
