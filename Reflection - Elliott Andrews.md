For this project the main contributions that I added to the project were, a template for the script and a problem severity graph.

The template helped us to develop a script when user testing, and making sure that we needed to cover all the important testing points. This was important as we need to remind the user that they were not being tested, and needed their full honest opinions.

The severity graph helped us to setup our issues, and to give us a clear idea of what we would need to work on for our second version of the prototype.

For the user testing, I was the **moderator**. My responsibility in this role was to guide the user through the testing process. 
This included:
*  Introducing the team and their roles
*  Introducing the system
*  Asking users to do certain tasks
*  Giving them the chance to talk
*  Thanking them for their time

Me and the others, were able to perform well in all our roles and responsibilites.

In terms of responsibility for the project itself, we were responsible to develop a usuability test plan, report the results and to have a disucssion on this as a team. I believe that as a team, we have done this well, and should be able to have lots to talk about for our next section (overall reflection).
