For this project the main contributions for the usability test plan is the questions we need to ask when we doing usability test.

The questions in our testing plan will make sure every tester will be asked same question, so our results more reliable.

For user tesing, I am responsible for record the user test session with screen capture and audio.

After we done all the user test l calculate the average rating based on the user rating, then l made a graph to show the testing results so we can easily see which part of project we did best and worst.
Finally me and other team member find out which part of our project we nned to improve, then we create an issue and give it a weight and lable based on severity.
