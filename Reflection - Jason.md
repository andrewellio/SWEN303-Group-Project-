For this project, I helped around in many areas such as helping to write the script we would be using for user testing, writing tasks, 
coming up with the metrics we would be using for guaging our system, reviewing the usability test after and moving our entire project onto
GitLab.

For user testing, my primary responsibility was as the note-taker, and I would basically try to write everything the users would say about the
system, including the ratings they give at the end of each task. In hindsight, because we have approved of video recordings of each user
interview, the next time I do this, I most likely would not record each and every thing the users said and instead focus on writing down the
main points such as what they found useful, the difficulties they had using the system etc, as I feel like I missed a couple important
notes due to my mistake of recording everything. Of course, this is subject to change if the specific user does not approve of a video
recording since the note taking would be our only and primary reflection of the testing session.

Overall, we worked well as a team for not just this assignment, but the entire project overall and I'm really glad I put was in this team.
We all get along and cover each other, and while we for the most part agree with many things, we still have our differences that allow us to
explore different options when implementing our designs and are able to discuss which one to use in a professional manner.
